    <h2>About me!</h2>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in my second year of Graphic Design at Algonquin College. Before this I graduated from a general arts and science design studies program. Originally I wanted to become an interior designer but after taking the design studies program and learning about graphic design I changed my direction. I like all the different subjects we learn in graphic design, but my focus is on strong typography. Aside from being a full-time student, I am also a part-time pharmacy technician and I work in network marketing as well. 
Outside of school and work some of my interests include biking, camping, hiking, drawing and skiing. Some random facts about me are: my favorite game is Blokus, my nickname is Dragon, and I am actually allergic to the cold air!
